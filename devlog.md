# Devlog - Project CodeTutor

## 22 August 2025

### Tasks completed:
- Created virtual environment for isolated installation of Flask
- created README.md, .gitignore, devlog.md
- created backend/app.py as an interface for Flask server
- created exercises/cpp and exercises/python for two courses
- created frontend folder
- created ForLoop.json for testing Flask
- created activ.bat to automate virtual environment activation and starting Flask server

### Problems faced
- failure in opening pythonForLoop.json in test server [404]: did not change python.json to pythonForLoop.json in app.py
- failure in opening exercise/pythonForLoop.json in test server [500: internal server error]: home folder found to have ex**c**ercise as name. Corrected to exercise.

### Next step
- generate an introduction page describing available courses
- expand topics for any one course
- make basic html interface

### Review
